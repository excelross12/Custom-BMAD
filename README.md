# BMAD Method - Universal AI-Driven Development Framework
**Version 4.44.1 (Universal Edition)**

Transform your development workflow with AI-powered agents that work with **any** AI coding assistant.

## What is BMAD?

**BMAD Method** (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a comprehensive framework that turns you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing specialized AI agents through structured workflows from concept to deployed code.

### Key Features

- **10 Specialized AI Agents** - Developer, Scrum Master, Architect, QA, and more
- **Universal Compatibility** - Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, Cline, GitHub Copilot, etc.
- **Structured Workflows** - Proven patterns from idea to production
- **Document-Driven** - PRDs, architecture docs, and user stories guide development
- **Sequential Development** - One story at a time, clean handoffs
- **Quality Gates** - Comprehensive testing and validation at every step

## Getting Started from GitHub

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/excelross12/Custom-BMAD.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd Custom-BMAD
```

### Step 2: Set Up in Your AI Environment

Choose your AI coding environment:

**Option A: Cursor IDE**
```bash
# Copy global rules to Cursor configuration
cp docs/global-bmad-rules.md .cursorrules

# Restart Cursor to load rules
```

**Option B: Windsurf**
```bash
# Add to Windsurf's AI configuration
# Settings > AI > Custom Rules
# Import: docs/global-bmad-rules.md
```

**Option C: Warp Terminal**
```bash
# Open Warp: Settings > AI > Rules
# Add Global Rule: docs/global-bmad-rules.md
# Name it: "BMAD Method"
```

**Option D: Other AI Tools (Cline, Aider, etc.)**
- Add `docs/global-bmad-rules.md` to your AI context
- Or include it in your project-specific configuration

### Step 3: Open the Visual Dashboard

```bash
# Open the beginner-friendly dashboard in your browser
open docs/bmad-dashboard.html   # macOS
start docs/bmad-dashboard.html  # Windows
```

The dashboard shows:
- Your current project phase
- What step to do next (highlighted in blue)
- All file locations
- Agent activation commands

### Step 4: Start Your First Project

In your AI assistant, type:

```
Act as BMAD Analyst. Let's start a new project.
```

The BMAD Analyst will:
- Ask you questions about your project
- Help you brainstorm features
- Create your project-brief.md

### Step 5: Follow the Workflow

Follow the dashboard or use this sequence:

```bash
# 1. Analysis & Brainstorming
"Act as BMAD Analyst"
# Creates: docs/project-brief.md

# 2. Product Requirements
"Act as BMAD Product Manager. Create PRD from project brief."
# Creates: docs/prd.md

# 3. Architecture Design
"Act as BMAD Architect. Create fullstack architecture."
# Creates: docs/architecture.md

# 4. Break into Epics
"Act as BMAD Product Owner. Shard the PRD into epics."
# Creates: docs/epics/epic-001-*.md

# 5. Create First Story
"Act as BMAD Scrum Master. Create story from epic-001."
# Creates: docs/stories/story-001-*.md

# 6. Implement Code
"Act as BMAD Developer. Implement story-001."
# Writes: src/ and tests/

# 7. Quality Review
"Act as BMAD QA. Review story-001."
# Validates and suggests improvements
```

## The 10 BMAD Agents

## Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning
```bash
# 1. Brainstorm -> 2. PRD -> 3. UX Design -> 4. Architecture -> 5. Shard Documents
```

### Phase 2: Development
```bash
# 6. Create Story -> 7. Implement -> 8. QA Review -> 9. Repeat
```

## Key Concepts

### Dev Notes (Context Preservation)

Every story ends with comprehensive Dev Notes that maintain context between stories:

```markdown
## Dev Notes

### What Worked
- JWT auth successful

### Decisions Made
- 7-day token expiry

### For Next Story
- Add rate limiting
```

### Sequential Development

1. One story at a time
2. Each story builds on previous Dev Notes
3. Maintains context throughout project

### Quality Gates

Before every commit:
```bash
npm test              # All tests pass
npm run lint          # Zero errors
npm run type-check    # Types clean
```
