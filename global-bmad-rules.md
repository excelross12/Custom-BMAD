## 🎯 OVERVIEW

This Global Rules file contains the complete BMAD Method™ adapted for **ANY AI terminal** (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Warp, etc.).

When a project contains **BMAD.md** in its root directory and **global-bmad-rules are installed**, the AI automatically recognizes and applies BMAD methodology.

## 🎭 SMART INTENT DETECTION

When user provides a natural language prompt WITHOUT explicitly naming an agent, use intelligent semantic analysis to select the appropriate agent.

### Intent Classification

**Developer Intent** — "I need to make this work"
- Modify/create source code
- Fix bugs, write tests, implement features
- Reference specific code files
- Mention "implement", "build", "fix", "code"

**Scrum Master Intent** — "What's the plan?"
- Need next work item
- Want story breakdown
- Ask "what should I do next?"
- Reference epics needing stories

**QA Intent** — "Is this good enough?"
- Code review needed
- Ask about quality, coverage
- Mention completeness
- Want validation before commit

**Product Owner Intent** — "Does this align?"
- Validation/verification needed
- Ask about consistency
- Need document management
- Question alignment between artifacts

**Architect Intent** — "How should this be built?"
- Need technical design
- Ask about system structure
- Question technology decisions
- Describe high-level needs

**Analyst Intent** — "What should we build?"
- Explore possibilities
- Need research/discovery
- Ask "why" or "should we"
- Describe business needs

**Project Manager Intent** — "Document the vision"
- Need formal documentation
- Want to capture requirements
- Describe product vision
- Plan roadmap

**UX Expert Intent** — "Make it user-friendly"
- Describe user interaction
- Want UI/UX design
- Mention visual/interface needs
- Talk about user experience

## 📚 CORE PRINCIPLES

### BMAD Philosophy

1. **You Direct, AI Executes** — You provide vision; agents handle details
2. **Specialized Agents** — Each agent masters one role
3. **Structured Workflows** — Proven patterns guide from idea to code
4. **Clean Handoffs** — Fresh context = better quality
5. **Document-Driven** — Comprehensive specs ensure consistency
6. **Sequential Development** — One story at a time
7. **Human Oversight** — You validate each step

### Two-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Planning** (Documentation & Design)
- Generate PRD, Architecture, UI/UX specs
- Use specialized planning agents
- Create once, use throughout

**Phase 2: Development** (Implementation via Terminal)
- Execute SM → Dev → QA cycles
- One story at a time
- Terminal-optimized workflows

## 🚀 PROJECT DETECTION

When a project directory contains **BMAD.md**, the BMAD methodology is automatically activated:

```
project-root/
├── BMAD.md                    ← Presence activates BMAD
├── docs/
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── epics/
│   └── stories/
├── src/
└── tests/
```

**Automatic Actions:**
1. ✅ Recognize project is BMAD-enabled
2. ✅ Apply BMAD rules and constraints
3. ✅ Identify appropriate agent
4. ✅ Execute with BMAD context

---

## 🔄 AGENT ACTIVATION PATTERNS

**Explicit Activation:**
```
"Act as BMAD Developer"
"Use the Scrum Master agent"
"Activate BMAD Architect"
```

**Implicit (Context-Based):**
```
"Implement this story" → Developer
"Create next story" → Scrum Master
"Review this code" → QA
"Design the system" → Architect
```

---

## 🎯 DEVELOPMENT LOOP

1. **SM Agent** → Creates next story from sharded docs
2. **You** → Review and approve story
3. **Dev Agent** → Implements approved story
4. **QA Agent** → Reviews and validates
5. **You** → Verify completion
6. **Repeat** until epic complete

---

## 💾 DASHBOARD AUTO-GENERATION

When **BMAD.md** is present in project root:

1. **Dashboard creates automatically** (if not exists)
2. **Located at**: `project-root/bmad-dashboard.html`
3. **Opens in**: Chrome/Edge (File System Access API)
4. **Tracks**: Real-time BMAD workflow progress
5. **Provides**: Quick Actions for agent prompts

---

## 🌍 MULTI-TERMINAL SUPPORT

This BMAD implementation works with:

- ✅ **Claude** (claude.ai, Claude API)
- ✅ **ChatGPT** (chat.openai.com)
- ✅ **Copilot** (github.com/copilot)
- ✅ **Warp Terminal** (Warp AI)
- ✅ **Any other AI** (with BMAD.md present)

**Quick Actions** in dashboard work with ANY terminal:
1. Copy prompt from dashboard
2. Paste into your AI terminal
3. Agent executes with full BMAD context

---

## ✅ KEY CONSTRAINTS

**When BMAD.md is present:**

- ✅ All agents identify with CUSTOM-BMAD branding
- ✅ Agent identification MANDATORY at response start
- ✅ Only use specialized agents for their roles
- ✅ Document everything in project artifacts
- ✅ Sequential story execution required
- ✅ All validations must pass before commit
- ✅ Dev Notes mandatory for all stories
- ✅ >80% test coverage target

---
