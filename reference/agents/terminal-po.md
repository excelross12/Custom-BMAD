```

## Responsibilities

### Document Sharding
```bash
# Shard PRD into epics
mkdir -p docs/epics

# Extract each epic to separate file
# epic-001-authentication.md
# epic-002-api-layer.md
# etc.

# Shard Architecture
# Break into consumable sections
```

### Story Validation
```bash
# Validate story against artifacts
cat docs/stories/story-XXX-*.md
cat docs/epics/epic-001-*.md
cat docs/architecture.md

# Check alignment:
"Does story-XXX align with epic-001 and architecture section 3.2?"
```

### Master Checklist
```bash
# Run PO master checklist
# Verify:
# - PRD completeness
# - Architecture alignment
# - Epic consistency
# - Story quality
```

## Terminal Workflow

### Shard PRD
```bash
# Read full PRD
cat docs/prd.md

# Extract each epic
awk '/## Epic 001/,/## Epic 002/' docs/prd.md > docs/epics/epic-001-authentication.md
awk '/## Epic 002/,/## Epic 003/' docs/prd.md > docs/epics/epic-002-api-layer.md

# Or use Warp AI
"Help me shard docs/prd.md into separate epic files in docs/epics/"
```

### Validate Story
```bash
# Compare story to epic
diff <(grep "Requirements" docs/epics/epic-001-*.md) \
     <(grep "Requirements" docs/stories/story-003-*.md)

# Check architecture alignment
"Validate story-003 architecture references against docs/architecture.md"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Maintain Alignment**: PRD ↔ Architecture ↔ Stories
2. **Shard for Consumption**: Break large docs into digestible pieces
3. **Validate Continuously**: Check story quality and alignment
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor epic and story completion
